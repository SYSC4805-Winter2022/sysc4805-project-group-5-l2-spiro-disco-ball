## SYSC4805 Project: Group 5 - Spiro Disco Ball
***
### **How to set up environment**
1. Pull most recent version from GitHub
2. Navigate to the folder in file explorer
3. Double click on the .ttt file to start scene in Coppeliasim
4. Run Scene
5. If the simulation results in an error, please save the scene as the scene path has not been created yet.

### **To run tests**
1. To test Boustrophedon algorithm run 
    - `lua Scripts/TestBoustrophedon.lua`
2. To test Cell Decomposition algorithm run 
    - `lua Scripts/TestCellDecomposition.lua`
3. To test Robot Body
    -  open the model.ttm located in ./Models folder 
    -  copy Scripts/TestRobotBody.lua code in to the RobotBody script 
    -  start the simulation 

### **Requirements**
1. Coppeliasim Education Edition (Version 4.2 or newer)
2. Git
